# Leaderboard

The best snake programs are displayed on the [leaderboard](/leaderboard).


## Submitting a program 

To get on the leaderboard, you can submit a program [here](https://github.com/aitournament/snake_web/issues/new/choose).
A round-robin tournament will be played between your program and all of the other programs on the leaderboard. Several thousand
games will be simulated between all programs. A win is worth 1 point, a tie is 1/2. Your program must beat at least one
other program to qualify for inclusion on the leaderboard.

## Testing

All of the programs listed on the leaderboard can be downloaded and played against with the web UI at <https://snake.aitournament.com>

If you want to play many games against an opponent, you can use the [snake runtime](https://github.com/aitournament/snake_runtime) to simulate
as many games as you want and gather statistics.
